# Biomarkers_analysis
Pancreatic cancer is an extremely deadly type of cancer. Once diagnosed, the five-year survival rate is less than 10%. However, if pancreatic cancer is caught early, the odds of surviving are much better. Unfortunately, many cases of pancreatic cancer show no symptoms until the cancer has spread throughout the body. A diagnostic test to identify people with pancreatic cancer could be enormously helpful  We have been approached by a client to help them create such a test.  They have a small dataset of biomarkers from the urine of three groups of patients: 
	•	Healthy controls
	•	Patients with non-cancerous pancreatic conditions, like chronic pancreatitis
	•	Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
When possible, these patients were age- and sex-matched. The goal was to develop an accurate way to identify patients with pancreatic cancer.  The key features are four urinary biomarkers: creatinine, LYVE1, REG1B, and TFF1. 
	•	Creatinine is a protein that is often used as an indicator of kidney function. 
	•	YVLE1 is lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1, a protein that may play a role in tumor metastasis
	•	REG1B is a protein that may be associated with pancreas regeneration
	•	TFF1 is trefoil factor 1, which may be related to regeneration and repair of the urinary tract
Age and sex, both included in the dataset, may also play a role in who gets pancreatic cancer. 
 The goal in this dataset is predicting diagnosis, and more specifically, differentiating between 3 (pancreatic cancer) versus 2 (non-cancerous pancreas condition) and 1 (healthy). The dataset includes information on stage of pancreatic cancer, and diagnosis for non-cancerous patients, but remember—these won't be available to a predictive model. The goal, after all, is to predict the presence of disease before it's diagnosed, not after!
